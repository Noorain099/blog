                <h2>Gear Up for an Electrifying Journey into Ethical Hacking!</h2>

                <br>In todayâ€™s digital age, cybersecurity has become more critical than ever, with organizations worldwide constantly battling against cyber threats. Understanding the importance of a secure online environment, the IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE) at Muffakham Jah College of Engineering and Technology (MJCET) hosted an Ethical Hacking Workshop on December 13, 2023. <br><br>Why Ethical Hacking?<br><br>
                    Ethical hacking is more than just finding vulnerabilities in systems; it's about making the digital world a safer place. Ethical hackers use their skills to identify security flaws and help prevent malicious attacks. As technology advances, so do the tactics of cybercriminals, and ethical hackers are on the frontlines, protecting data and safeguarding privacy.</p>
